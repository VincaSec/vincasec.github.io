Hello! My name is **VincaSec**, and Iâ€™m a **Business Informatics** student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and cybersecurity. I got into tech early and have always been amazed by the systems that run our digital world.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn  various programming languages and technologies like **C#, SQL, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C, MongoDB and ASP.NET**. I also worked on projects creating web and desktop applications, and learned **SAP Fiori** basics. While studying, I took the **CCNA** course alongside my studies, where I gained a strong understanding of networking concepts and how the internet works.

My interest in cybersecurity really started during the COVID-19 lockdown. I spent a lot of time reading tech books, keeping up with current events, and trying out **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenges on sites like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**. These challenges sparked my passion for ethical hacking, and I've been hooked ever since.

Additionally, I am a proud member of [Bezbedan Balkan Forum](https://bezbedanbalkan.net/), a community where cybersecurity enthusiasts, professionals, and hackers from the Balkan region gather to share knowledge, collaborate on security challenges, and discuss the latest trends and tactics in the cybersecurity world. The forum has provided me with a wealth of resources and the opportunity to network with like-minded individuals in the field of cybersecurity.
