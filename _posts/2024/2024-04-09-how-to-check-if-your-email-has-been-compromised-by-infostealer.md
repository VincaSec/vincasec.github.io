### What is an Infostealer?

Malware known as **infostealer** seeks and steals personal data explicitly. Once within your system, they work in the background, frequently going unnoticed, sending hackers your important data. Financial fraud, identity theft, and dark web sales are all possible with this info.

### Don’t Store Passwords in Browsers
